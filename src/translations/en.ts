        content: `[ELECOMP 2025](https://www.elecompiran.com/) exhibition demonstrated with its wide participation of companies and visitors that it remains one of the most important technology events in Iran; an event that has both public appeal and special importance for technology professionals.

## 1. Strong Presence of Participants and Exhibitors

The crowd of visitors and multitude of booths reflected the high appeal of this exhibition. From emerging startups to large corporations and banks, everyone was trying to have a share in this event.

## 2. Presence of Banks and Financial Institutions

Banks such as [Saman](https://www.sb24.ir), [Eghtesad Novin](https://www.enbank.ir/), and [Tejarat](https://www.tejaratbank.ir/) were present at ELECOMP. This presence demonstrates their serious interest in new technologies; both in terms of investment and networking with emerging and technology-based businesses.

## 3. Operators and Communication Giants

One of the remarkable sections of the exhibition was the presence of mobile operators. Hamrah Aval, by allocating a complete hall and diverse booth designs, managed to attract various audiences from gamers to software developers. Irancell and Rightel were also active in this area.

An important point was the introduction of new generation eSIM-based phones that operators were trying to attract new customers by introducing them.

## 4. Limited International Presence

Due to sanctions and political conditions, foreign companies were mostly limited to China; mostly for selling hardware components. The absence of companies from Iran's neighboring countries was also questionable, as the regional market could be an important opportunity for Iranian companies.

## 5. State of Artificial Intelligence in Iran

Although a dedicated AI hall was a sign of the importance of this field, the reality is that Iran still lacks a strong national AI base or center. The so-called "AI Center" building remains unused, which is concerning.

Developing clear regulations for the use of AI in government institutions could be one of the necessary steps.

## 6. Data Security: Old Concern, New Importance

Given global developments and even recent wars, data security has become more important than ever. The Deputy Minister of Communications also emphasized this issue at the exhibition. The presence of companies active in infrastructure and cybersecurity shows that this need has been understood.

## 7. University Participation

Universities such as [Sharif](https://www.sharif.ir/), [Mazandaran](https://umz.ac.ir/), and [Ilam](https://www.ilam.ac.ir/), by allocating booths to introduce their research and technological products, played a promising role in the exhibition. This demonstrates universities' attention to investing in new technologies.

## 8. Focus on Young Generation

One of the interesting points of the exhibition was the presence of Teeno Stars; a collection that brought together teenage talents to provide technological solutions for society's problems. Interestingly, many of the ideas from these teenagers seemed more serious and practical than the booths of large companies.

## 9. Exhibition Management Weaknesses

Lack of sufficient creativity in the exhibition's official website; to the extent that even a digital map of the halls was not available. This while it was possible to solve this problem with services like [Balad](https://balad.ir/) or [Neshan](https://neshan.org/).

Although the speech panels were well received, weak advertising and lack of online streaming limited access for the general interested public.

Advertising was often limited to using loudspeakers and paper brochures; while simple technologies like QR codes or NFC could have transformed visitors' experiences.

## 10. Participant Problems

Many companies had not fully prepared their products and merely presented a half-finished version for participation in the exhibition.

Some startups were still in the early stages and had only participated with the aim of attracting capital or being seen. Although this can create opportunities, it also shows a lack of capital and support.

## 11. Excessive Paper Consumption

Despite all the talk about the environment and green technology, paper brochures were still distributed abundantly. The lack of a digital exhibition booklet and insistence on a physical version was an example of this weakness.

## Conclusion

ELECOMP 2025 presented a dual picture of Iran's technology situation:

On one hand, the widespread presence of companies, banks, operators, and even innovative teenagers promises a bright future.

On the other hand, problems such as the lack of strong infrastructure for artificial intelligence, the absence of foreign companies (except China), weak exhibition management, and lack of investment still persist.

However, this year's experience showed that ELECOMP remains the main platform for introducing technology and innovation in Iran; a platform that, if accompanied by better management and investment, can play an important role in transforming the country's digital economy.`
